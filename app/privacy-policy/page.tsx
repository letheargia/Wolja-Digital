                    Wolja Digital recognizes the complexities of cross-border
                    data movement, particularly when transferring personal data
                    between our EU and Georgian entities. We are committed to
                    ensuring robust protection of personal data throughout such
                    transfers, adhering strictly to the General Data Protection

                    When transferring personal data between our EU and Georgian
                    entities, we exclusively rely on European
                    Commission-approved Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs),
                    which provide comprehensive legal safeguards for data
                    subjects. These clauses establish stringent obligations for
                    data protection, ensuring that personal information receives
                    equivalent levels of protection during and after
                    international transfer.

                    Our transfer mechanism includes multiple layers of security.
                    We implement end-to-end encryption during data transmission,
                    restrict access to transferred data through multi-factor
                    authentication, and maintain detailed logs of all
                    cross-border data movements. Prior to any transfer, we
                    conduct thorough transfer impact assessments to evaluate
                    potential risks and implement necessary mitigation
                    strategies.
